## Jana Tahir - Portfolio
I put (h1) as home for the main text. basic things about boostrap is columns and containers. Containers is the biggest box that contains everything.
 Boostrap only uses classes that they have. I put a "text-center" from boostrap to cneter my text. 
 For the four images in the home page I am going to do 
<div class="home-images row">
I am going to use "btn btn- dark" for the see more button.
I will also be using justify-content-center to center my dark see more button in the homepage.
What I learnt while doing this project is I have to use exclamation mark Important (!Important) for my background colour to work. 
I also learnt that active is showing if the link is actually active or not. Having that class is what gets the links yto work with all pages.
A challenge for me is to properly put my copyright and my text would always not show so that would fustrate me until I realize I need to put text-light. 
I made a label for many things in my contact page. I made a label for the name, email, subject and message. The input type I put was text and the class is form-control. 
I learnt that by adding a linear gradient is applied as a backdrop picture to the backgrounds by adding a.bg-gradient class. The bottom of this gradient is a faded-out semi-transparent white towards the top.
I learnt more about flexbox and grid by doing this assignment, and I was able to use Bootstrap correctly and to my advantage.
Updating the navigation in each page was a challenge for me as I had to make sure that I put the active styles on the right navigation buttons. But I took my time to update them and I have a consistent navigation throughout the site.
